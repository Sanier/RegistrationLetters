# RegistrationLetters

## Project Description

This project was made as a test task. The main idea is that the project is a prototype of a system for registering incoming letters addressed to company employees.

And because This is a prototype, meaning there are some violations in the architecture, in particular in the WPF client. Please note that the project was created from scratch in 4 days.

If you have a desire to make changes or various improvements, then the project is completely open to this and I will be happy to study them :)
